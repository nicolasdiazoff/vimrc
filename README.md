# nicolasdiazoff's VIM setup

I want to share my vim configuration because I think it can be useful to you. The truth is that I do not add many complicated configurations, I try to keep my configuration minimalist to be able to run vim on any computer that I need, especially on servers. Although I use vim in my day to day programming, I also like other editors like vscode. If you have any recommendation do not hesitate to make your contribution.

## About

This my vimrc setup. Keeping your vim setup in a Git repository
is cool because you can track the changes you do to your set up,
you can rollback if something goes wrong, you can branch and
test new settings while keeping your base setup stable...

Also, pushing my vimrc to GitHub is nice because I have an
online backup. In case I format my PC or want to install vim into
a new computer, I just have to clone my repository and it's done.

There's another reason for pushing my vimrc setup online. You can
share your setup with everybody, let people learn from what you're
done. I like to browse other vimrc repos here at GitHub and learn
from their experience. I know my vimrc setup is tiny and modest but
I'm proud of it.

## Requirements

* Git
* Plug
* nodejs
* npm

## Set up

I use Plug like a plugins manager, you will need install and run the command :PlugInstall to install all plugins
I use too Prettier and EsLint to develop on react and javascript to use that run npm install

## Disclaimer

This is MY vimrc setup and it is opinionated and made to work how I
want.  Anyone can download and use my vimrc, but unless you and me are
the same person, you'll probably find things that you don't want. It is
OK. Use this vimrc as a starting point for making your own.

**Under no circumstances I am responsible for any kind of damage
derived from the use of this vimrc on your machine. If you lose files,
if your Vim install breaks, if something explodes. My vimrc comes with
no warranties. Again; you shouldn't play with my toys if you don't want
to get hurt.** (This doesn't mean my vimrc will hurt you, you know, but
this is legal boilerplate to cover my ass _in case_ something happens).
